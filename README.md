## üí° Proof of concept

The goal of this project is to apply and demonstrate microservice architecture in relatively small area as collecting text-based resources. There are many areas to improve, but I want to keep it simple to show how microservices architecture can be applied in this case.

Only local hosting was used there for simplicity. Auth0 was used for authentication and JWT tokens were used for authorization. Auth0 is a cloud service that provides a single sign-on solution for your applications and is described here as Auth microservice. Frontend is pretty basic and its goal was not to provide a full-featured frontend for the backend.
